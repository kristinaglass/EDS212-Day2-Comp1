## Derivatives in R

```{r}
fx = expression(3.1 * (x ^ 4) -28 * x)

#This is not executed (a comment)
#this is storing the derivative expression
df_dx <- D(fx, 'x')

#this is calling it back
df_dx

x <- 10

eval(df_dx)
```

\
Try finding the slope of g(z) = 2z \^3 - 10.5z \^2 +4.1 at z = 3.6

```{r}

gz <- expression(2 * z^3 - 10.5 * z^2 + 4.1)

##storing expression
dg_dz <- D(gz, 'z')

##calling it back
dg_dz

z <- seq(from = 1, to = 3, length = 20)

eval(dg_dz)
```
